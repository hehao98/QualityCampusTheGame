## 概述 (High Level Concept/Design)

### Game Title

> *Your game’s title should communicate the gameplay and the style of the game*

《建设世界一流大学》（暂定）

### Concept Statement

> *The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.*

《建设世界一流大学》是一个极简的策略类模拟游戏，玩家的任务是规划一所中国大学的建设与发展，规划学校政策，建设品质校园，力争为师生打造能够高效学习与科研的环境，为世界一流大学的建设添砖加瓦！你的合理建设能使得师生全身心投入学习与科研，国际排名不断上升，最终成为世界一流大学！不过，如果你的建设有问题的话，会发生什么就不得而知了...

### Game Genre

> *Single genre is clearer but often less interesting. Genre combinations can be risky. Beware of ‘tired’ genres.*

策略、模拟、文字、黑色幽默

### Target Audience

> *Motivations and relevant interests; potentially age, gender, etc.; and the desired ESRB rating for the game.*

当然是任何一个有过大学生活经历的人，尤其是经历过中国特色“世界一流大学”的大学教育的人，会在这个游戏中得到更加深刻的感触~

### Unique Selling Points

> ***Critically important.*** *What makes your game stand out? How is it different from all other games?*



## 产品设计 (Product Design)

### Player Experience and Game POV

> *Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the player? What emotions do you want the player to feel? What keeps the player engaged for the duration of their play?*

### Visual and Audio Style

> *What is the “look and feel” of the game? How does this support the desired player’s experience? What concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game?*

### Game World Fiction

> *Briefly describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms (as presented to the player).*

### Monetization

> *How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this within the design?*

### Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief)

> *PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript? How long to make, and how big a team? How long to first-playable? How long to complete the game? Major risks?*

## 游戏系统设计 (Game System Design)

### Core Loops

> *How do game objects and the player’s actions form loops? Why is this engaging? How does this support player goals? What emergent results do you expect/hope to see? If F2P, where are the monetization points?*

### Objectives and Progression

> *How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from tutorial to end? What are their short-term and long-term goals (explicit or implicit)? How do these support the game concept, style, and player-fantasy?*

### Game Systems

> *What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the player interact with?*

### Interactivity

> *How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog, Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does the player move through the world? How does physics/combat/etc. work? A clear, professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.*
